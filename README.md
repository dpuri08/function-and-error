# Module1 Solidity Contract

This repository contains a basic Solidity smart contract named `MetaModule1` that showcases some simple functions. It includes functionalities related to voting, calculations, and a simplified version of a Ludo game.

## Functions

### Voting

The `voting` function allows individuals to vote if they are at least 18 years old. It ensures that the minimum age requirement is met before allowing the vote.

### Calculation

The `calculate` function performs a division operation between two integers `x` and `y`. It ensures that the denominator `y` is not zero before performing the division.

### Ludo Game

The `ludo` function simulates a Ludo game. It enforces a rule that a group must not exceed 4 players for the game.
